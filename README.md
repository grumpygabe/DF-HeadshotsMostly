# DF-HeadshotsMostly
 
A headshots "mostly" mode.

# Requirements
I set this up with [Darkness Falls](https://gitlab.com/KhaineGB/darkness-falls-a20/-/tree/main) in mind, but I'm not actually sure it requires it. YMMV.

# Description
This mod reduces non-headshot damage from most sources.  Explosives are excluded.  It is fairly configurable.  
* You can adjust the amount of damage reduction from non-headshots.  It is set to -1 by default (no damage) but -0.5 (half damage) is also pretty good.
* You can give an additional bonus to headshot damage, if you feel like it.  No bonus by default.
* You can increase the chance of dismemberment to limb shots if you feel like it.  No bonus by default.
* You can adjust (roughly) which weapon types are included in the reduction/bonuses.

To configure, see Config/entityclasses.xml and read the comments.

# Installation
It's easy. Drop the DF-HeadshotsMostly folder into in your mods folder.
